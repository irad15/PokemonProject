# Random Battle vs Bot Feature

## Overview
The Random Battle vs Bot feature allows users to battle against an AI opponent using their favorite Pokemon. This feature is accessible through the Arena section of the Pokemon Project.

## Features

### 1. User Interface
- **Favorites Display**: Shows all user's favorite Pokemon in a responsive grid layout
- **Pokemon Selection**: Users can click on any favorite Pokemon to select it for battle
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected Pokemon is highlighted with a green border and background
- **Battle Setup**: After selection, shows both the user's Pokemon and a randomly generated bot Pokemon
- **Stats Comparison**: Displays key stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed) for both Pokemon

### 2. Bot Pokemon Generation
- **Random Selection**: Bot Pokemon is randomly selected from Pokemon IDs 1-1025
- **Real Pokemon Data**: Uses the PokeAPI to fetch actual Pokemon data including sprites and stats
- **Battle Score Calculation**: Calculates battle scores using the same algorithm as player battles

### 3. Battle Integration
- **Seamless Transition**: "Start Battle" button redirects to the existing battle page
- **Battle Data Storage**: Creates a challenge entry that the battle page can access
- **Battle Recording**: Records the battle in user's battle history

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

#### Client-side Files:
1. **`Client/vs-bot.html`** - Main page structure
2. **`Client/vs-bot.css`** - Styling for the page
3. **`Client/vs-bot.js`** - JavaScript functionality

#### Server-side Files:
1. **`server.js`** - Added `/api/arena/create-bot-battle` endpoint

### Key Functions

#### Client-side (`vs-bot.js`):
- `loadUserFavorites()` - Loads user's favorite Pokemon from server
- `displayFavorites()` - Renders favorites in grid format
- `selectPokemon(pokemonId)` - Handles Pokemon selection
- `generateBotPokemon()` - Creates random bot Pokemon
- `calculateBattleScore(stats)` - Calculates battle score
- `startBattle()` - Initiates the battle process

#### Server-side (`server.js`):
- `POST /api/arena/create-bot-battle` - Creates bot battle and stores battle data

### Data Flow
1. User visits `/arena/vs-bot`
2. Page loads user's favorites from `/api/favorites`
3. User selects a Pokemon (triggers bot Pokemon generation)
4. User clicks "Start Battle"
5. Battle data is sent to `/api/arena/create-bot-battle`
6. User is redirected to `/battle?challengeId=<battleId>`
7. Battle page loads and executes the battle

### Error Handling:
- **No Favorites**: Shows message directing user to search page

2. **Battle Animations**: More sophisticated battle animations
3. **Bot Strategy**: AI that selects Pokemon based on user's choice
4. **Battle Rewards**: Points or achievements for winning
5. **Battle Statistics**: Track win/loss ratios against bots

### Technical Enhancements:
1. **Caching**: Cache Pokemon data to reduce API calls
